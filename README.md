# gulis-chat

More advanced Python course

## Objective

In this course we will create a simple chat client in Python with a graphical user interface.
We learn how to communicate with a server and how to encryption works.

## Content

1. Learn how our servers API works and how to communicate with it
2. Create a simple command line client and communicate with the server
3. Perfect our command line client
4. Learn how to make a graphical user interface.
5. Build our chat client - part 1
6. Build our chat client - part 2
7. Learn about encryption
8. Add encryption to our chat client

## Who this is for

This course is meant for those who have some previous knowledge in Python programming and for those who want a challenge.

If the graphical user interface seems like a too difficult topic, you can always do the command line client and even add encryption to it and finnish the GUI later.

## Prerequisites

This course is in Python, therefore Python must be installed on your computer.

We also recommend using PyChar IDE for this course. Learn more about what it is and how to get it, [here](https://datateknologerna-vid-abo-akademi.github.io/gulis/TOOLS.html#jetbrains).

Another tool we recommend and will be using in this course, is [Insomnia REST Client](https://insomnia.rest).

## How to start

This course is split up in parts and each part has it's own folder in this repository.

All parts have README.md files, which contain the main content. Additionally there can be code examples or other additional files in each part.

You can either read the README's in each part via GitHub, or you can clone this repository and read them from your computer.
````sh
git clone https://github.com/Datateknologerna-vid-Abo-Akademi/gulis-chat
````

## The server

If you are keen to play with the server for your self, take a look in the `server` directory of this repository.

A fair warning though, the server is written in [Go](https://golang.org), so maybe everyone shouldn't play around in the code.

You are of course free to run it locally, just follow the instructions of the README.md file.
